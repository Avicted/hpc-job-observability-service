# oapi-codegen configuration for Slurm REST API client
# This generates a runtime-free Go client from the Slurm OpenAPI spec
# Run: go generate ./...
#
# Note: The original Slurm OpenAPI spec (slurm-openapi.json) contains multiple API versions.
# We use a filtered spec (slurm-openapi-v0.0.37.json) that only includes v0.0.37 paths
# to avoid duplicate operation ID conflicts. To support a different API version:
# 1. Update the filter script in docs/development.md
# 2. Regenerate: go generate ./internal/slurmclient/...
